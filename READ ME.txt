Preparing for build
- Fixed an issue where Vue needed to have an element in the template
	- Through the PostComponent and img into a div
- Found an issue where when the text is too long it extends out of the box
	- will wrap the text in a final project
	- Resolved? []
- Fixed the issue with promise being asynchronous
	- Used a .then, .catch method
- In the console of the terminal I got an error "66DPYF3B.js:1 Uncaught (in promise) Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '_RUNTIME_')"
	- Hoping this magically disappears

Starting vue client
- when running 'vue create client' got: cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system
	- To check this, run 'Get-ExecutionPolicy' and it should return Restricted
	- To solve this, run 'Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy "RemoteSigned"
		- Make sure this worked, run 'Get-ExecutionPolicy' and it should return "RemoteSigned"
	- Setup vue, 'vue create client'
		- Set it back to restricted, 'Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Restricted'
Creating Post Service
- cd into client
- npm i axios
- npm run serve
- has to be "import axios from 'axios';"
- Current issue with having async in promise but will revisit

Creating Post Component
- Current issue with displaying the date of the posts
	- For the date make sure you use ` instead of '

I FINALLY FIXED DELETE
- Okay I am really dumb but make sure it is:
	- "await posts.deleteOne({ _id: new mongodb.ObjectId(req.params.id) });"
	- and not, "await posts.deleteOne({ _id: new mongodb.ObjectId(req.params.id) });"
	- basically, in the tutorial, online, and a bunch of other places have it as "ObjectID" when it's supposed to be "ObjectId"

Leaving project here will add middle man next step.
Known Issues:
	-async in promise but will revisit

Currently API works properly

Update Posts works as expected
Get Posts works as expected
Add Posts works as expected

Delete Posts currently causes the app to crash
- "await posts.deleteOne({_id: new mongodb.ObjectID(req.params.id)" TypeError: mongodb.ObjectID is not a constructor
- chatGPT said "Starting from version 4.x of the MongoDB Node.js driver, the mongodb package no longer exports the ObjectID constructor directly. Instead, you can use the bson package to create ObjectID instances."
    - I tried to use the bson package to create ObjectID instances but got the same TypeError
    - added:
        - const { ObjectID } = require('bson');
        - await posts.deleteOne({_id: new ObjectID(req.params.id)
        - "bson": "^6.1.0",
            - in the package.json folder
- Original Code:
    - [No bson line]
    - await posts.deleteOne({ _id: new mongodb.ObjectID(req.params.id) });
    - [no package line]

If I need to in the future it's 'npm install bson'
